Joining the Flutter Bounty Hunters doesn't guarantee any work. The Flutter Bounty Hunters receive funding sporadically, and therefore Bounty Hunters work on projects sporadically. If the team receives enough funded work, you will be invited to join a project for a given development milestone. The more work that you do, and the higher the quality, the more likely you are to be invited to join future projects.
