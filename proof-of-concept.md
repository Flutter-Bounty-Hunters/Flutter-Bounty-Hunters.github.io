# What is a Proof-of-Concept?
A Flutter Bounty Hunters **Proof-of-Concept project** is a new project thatâ€™s **searching for funding**.

From time to time the Flutter Bounty Hunters come up with ideas for new projects without any request from funding companies. Rather than pitch companies on the **idea** of a new project, we invest the time to build a prototype that **demonstrates** the project concept. This prototype demonstrates that the Flutter Bounty Hunters are capable of building the new project, and also demonstrates why we think the project is valuable.
